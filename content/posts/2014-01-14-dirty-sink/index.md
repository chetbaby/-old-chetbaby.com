If the kitchen is the heart of the house, then what’s the heart of the kitchen?

The sink.

When the sink doesn’t function, the kitchen can’t function, and when the kitchen can’t function, then the house becomes dysfunctional.

When you see a dirty sink there are 3 different reactions you can have:

  1. Gross. I’ll wait for someone else to do it.
  2. I’ll get to it later when I have time.
  3. Time to clean.

Of these 3 perspectives, the first one is the worst. The second is the most common. And the last one is the only one based in reality.

The way we look at a dirty sink says a lot about how we face challenges in life. We can skate along hoping to ride the hypothetical wave of good fortune or other godly intervention that we are surely due (self-entitlement). We can fill our hearts with plans and promises for another day, any day—just not today (ineffectual). Or we can get to work—without ego, without disgust, and without resentment for the job in front of us (clarity).

The dirty sink is a gift. It’s just waiting for you to accept it.
